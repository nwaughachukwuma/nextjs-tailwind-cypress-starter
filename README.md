This is my personal setup for quickly whipping up a project based on Next.js, Tailwind and Cypress, and off course Typescript. Cypress is configured for both e2e and component testing to keep things uniform, so you don't have to use Jest or Mocha or any other library together with Cypress. I've also added basic github actions workflows to run the cypress test and to check the ts,tsx files on CI.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```
