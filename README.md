This is my personal setup for quickly whipping up a project based on `Next.js`, `Tailwind`, `Cypress`, and off course `Typescript`. `Cypress` is configured for both e2e and component testing to keep things uniform, so you don't have to use `Jest` or `Mocha` or any other library together with `Cypress`.

I've also added basic `github actions` workflows to run the Cypress tests and to check the ts,tsx files on `CI`. Get coding ðŸ’ª ðŸš€

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```
